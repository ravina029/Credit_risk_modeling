# Credit Risk modeling using Machine Learning:
1. This project involves analyzing the data of a bank customer and finding out the level of credit risk about the customer.
2. After data claening and feature selection three models were trained to classify the customer in four different categories P!,P2,P3 and P4.
3. Out of Decision Tree Classifier, RandomforestClassifier and XgBoostClassifier, XgBoost gave the best accuracy precision and recall score.
4. XgBoostClassifier is further fine tuned to get the best performance metric. 




# steps:
1. data igestion from : 

data_link1="https://github.com/ravina029/datasets/raw/main/case_study1.xlsx"
data_link2="https://github.com/ravina029/datasets/raw/main/case_study2.xlsx"

For checking the performance of model on unseen_data="https://github.com/ravina029/datasets/raw/main/Unseen_Dataset.xlsx"


# Note:
As we have around 42 features therefore use exe file instead of flask.
